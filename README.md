Important Notice:

The plugin ID has been changed from 10015 to 20000.

According to current specification, the constant ID of a plugin with an ID of 10000 for theme 1, 2â€¦ is 10000, 10001,.. and so on. This means that the ID of constants others than the primary theme can possibly clash with constants of another plugin.

To avoid such conflict, the ID of certain plugins may mauve to be adjusted.

This may have negative effect on existing code (4D methods) that are tokenized using the previous version. Users are advised to preserve the textual content of the method before replacing the plugin with a later version.
